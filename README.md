# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
## Problem Statement
To build a model for Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning. In this
project machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, ridge regression, lasso
regression and random forest regressor have been used.

## Implementation

Tools & Libraries -
● Numpy:- Used to support Panda frameworks.
● Pandas:- To Create Dataframe of the Image Pixel Values.
● Sklearn:- Python Library used for machine learning and statistical modelling
including classification.
● Matplotlib:-Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated,
and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and
hard things possible. Create publication quality plots.
● Seaborn:- Data visualization library that is commonly used for data science and
machine learning tasks. It is used to create interactive plots to answer questions
about data.
 ## Algorithms used
● Linear Regression
● Rigde Regression
● Lasso Regression
● Random Forest Regression

## Conclusion
An investigation into individual health insurance data is conducted using two regression
models.Out of the four models used above, Random forest regressor has better
accuracy. Any unneeded attribute was removed from each of the features. Premiums
are determined by a person's health rather than the terms and conditions of another
insurance provider. Some other algorithms can be employed to predict premiums based
on data and improve accuracy. People and insurance companies can work together to
deliver better and more health-focused coverage as a result of this.
